# Round 2 Guidelines

## General Instructions
- Questions are uploaded in a folder, and each team is allowed to choose **one** question.
- **Attempt only one** question, as only one will be considered.
- After completing your solution, submit the repository link in the provided form. **Only commits made before the deadline will be considered.**

## Task-Specific Instructions
- In your repository, name your file as follows: `TeamName_Qno.html`.
- Ensure that when your code is run, the output matches what is asked in the task.
- Teams are given **two** tasks to complete. Follow the given prompt and apply your creative approach.
- **Read the prompt carefully**. If you have any doubts regarding the task or differences in interpretation, feel free to clarify before starting.
- Scoring for the tasks:
  - **Task 1**: 60 points
  - **Task 2**: 90 points
- Scoring is based on the following criteria:
  - How closely the GIF aligns with the prompt given in the task.
  - Creativity and styling applied.

## Additional Rule
- Refrain from using AI solutions to solve the problem. You are free to use the internet as a resource, but **copying the entire code** will result in disqualification.
- **Frameworks or CDN link embedding is not allowed**; use pure CSS only.

Good luck!  ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨
